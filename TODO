__Minor Additions__
	- add argparse,  allow for logging.conf as param (requires 2.7)
	- unittest + doc crawler.commands.base + jobs + image
	- restrict domain by using a 'restrict_domain' config sent to HttpAgent
	- move regex into config instead of statics in the command
	- beter doc the commands
	


__Feature 1__
	- Command thread to pause/status/resume


__Feature 2__
	- Could performance be improved by moving agents to one per thread
		instead of being singletons with locks
	- store ref to thread in threading.local, so that the agents can hand 
		out a reference based on the thread ?

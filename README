- better logging (seperate verbose messages from useful ones, such as 'image saved', 'page followed',  + summary stats)
- load config for each class

Uses PIL for image processing (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
-Not in use- Uses urllib3 for thread safe http connections, and connection pooling by domain (http://code.google.com/p/urllib3/)
